# BitcoinKeyConverter
Converts hex format bitcoin private keys to WIF format safely, offline. Option to dump converted keys to file.

Uses https://gist.github.com/CodesInChaos/3175971 for base58 encoding.

No real error handling so beware, only 64 character hex format bitcoin keys are taken. I wrote it quickly for myself so I could parse hundreds of keys safely offline instead of using a website like https://gobittest.appspot.com/PrivateKey.
