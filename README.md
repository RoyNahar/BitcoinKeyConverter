# BitcoinKeyConverter
Converts hex format bitcoin private keys to WIF format.

Uses https://gist.github.com/CodesInChaos/3175971 for base58 encoding.

NO ERROR HANDLING so beware, I wrote it quickly for myself so I could parse hundreds of keys safely offline instead of using https://gobittest.appspot.com/PrivateKey for example.

Built version here https://github.com/joesciii/BitcoinKeyConverter/releases/tag/v0.1
